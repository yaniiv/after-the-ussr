          At the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, there were 53 ethnic
          homelands, 15 of which became successor states to the Soviet Union. In
          the 14 newly independent nation states, about <span class="emph">XX% </span>of the population
          consisted of Russians. Members of this Russian diaspora had lost their status

            At the same time, international emigration for all FSU members
            became a practical option for the first time since XXX. Previous to
            the collapse, trying to travel without explicit permission from the

            To get a picture of Post-Soviet migration patterns, we’ll look at
            the reconcentration of soviet ethnic groups around their homeland, and take a brief glimpse at 
            some of the primary streams of migration to countries outside the FSU
            between 1989 and 2002.

            When looking at the percentage of Russians that left against the
            total amount in each State, Tajikistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan and
            Georgia lost close to or over half of their Russian citizenry.

            This may be in part due to weak and struggling infrastructure in
            these countries. Migrants left in pursuit of work opportunities (ADD STUFF I WROTE HERE).

            What’s interesting is that in spite of continued immigration into the country,
            Russias population has been declining by 0.5% annually after peaking
            at 148.7 million in 1992. With this XXX mil citizens immigrating into the country,
            how could the population be declining? (UPDATE TO LINEGRAPH)

        <div class="step" data-scrollama-index="7" style="height: 1063px;">
          <p>
            Some of the decline is due to the steep increase in mortality rate and
            decrease in birth rate in Russia. These were of the tolls of
            navigating the collapse of an ideology (edit here). Since 1992,
            deaths have exceeded births, and net immigration to the country alone
            has not been able to offset the decline. (UPDATE TO LINEGRAPH birth & death)

            A significant part of the drop in Russias population was
            due to large waves of migrants seeking refuge and stability outside
            of the FSU entirely. Migration to the far abroad consisted of 3 groups: Germans,
            Russians, and Jews. (NO ANIMATION OR PIE CHART OF %'s)

            In Germany, net migration consisted of soviet germans attracted by
            the generous resettlement package for the aussiedler (cultural
            germans) and strong german economy. The aussiedler were welcomed
            enthusiastically as fellow German compatriots who would be a benefit
            to the economy

            Meanwhile, Israel was welcoming soviet jewish migrants with open
            arms. Israels founding purpose is to be a safe haven for Jews all
            around the world. Life for jews in the Soviet Union was already
            difficult. Jews were persecuted and oppressed as a matter of policy
            by the soviet regime. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, things
            got even worse.

            As soon as the Iron Curtain came down, The 1990s
            Post-Soviet aliyah began en mass. Between 1989 and 2006, over 1.6
            million soviet jews and their non-jewish relatives and spouses moved
            to Israel, protected under the “Law of Return” which stated that
             "every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh
            [immigrant]." (ANIMATE TO IMMIGRATION PER YEAR LINE GRAPH)

            Overall, About 61%, of Soviet Jews migrated to Israel. Another
            325,000 migrated to the United States, and 219,000 migrated
            to Germany.[2][3]

            The United States was an important benefactor of all soviet
            immigrants. Between 1974 and 1990 the majority of Soviet Jews chose
            to travel to the United States over Israel. The United States had a
            policy of treating Soviet Jews as refugees under the Jackson-Vanik
            amendment

            In 1989, 71,000 Soviet Jews emigrated, of whom only 12,117
            immigrated to Israel. In Vienna, a major transit point for
            immigration to Israel, some 83% chose to go to the United States.

            To go around this, many Soviet Jews first migrated to Israel, and
            then applied for Visas in the USA as Israeli Citizens. By 2000, xxxx
            immigrants had come to USA. The largest receiving cities of soviet
            migration were New York, XXXX, XXXX, and XXX.
