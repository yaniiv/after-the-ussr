            My name is Yaniv, and I built this story because I’m passionate
            about using data to tell human stories. After seeing some really
            cool work by publications like
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.pudding.cool">The Pudding</a>, I thought I’d
            try my hand at a visual essay. This is my first take at doing so.
          </div>
          <div class="overlay-text">
            I picked this topic because my family was a part of the Post-Soviet
            migration, and I wanted to learn more about their experience. I
            myself am a Russian speaker, born in Israel, who grew up in America.
            I have family spread across all 3 countries. Developing this essay
            helped me make make a bit of sense of that whole situation.

              However, in 1989 Mikahel Gorbachev lifted restrictions on
              emigration for jews, and the United States stopped treating Soviet
              Jews as refugees. The United States sought to limit the influx of
              emigrants by imposing a ceiling of 50 thousand for the coming
              years. Numbers of Soviet Jews going to the USA started dropping as
              more went to Israel.

              Still, The United States, with its large Jewish community, was an
              important location for Soviet Immigrants and received over roughly
              half a million Soviet immigrants.

              In summary, far more of the Russian diaspora population decided to
              assimilate into their respective CIS nations than felt the need to
              return to Russia. As conditions worsened after the collapse,
              masses of Soviet Immigrants fled the the country and sought safety
              and economic stability abroad.

              However, the emigration boom from the CIS was not actually as
              large as many experts had feared (estimates of possible outflow
              from the former USSR territory varied from 1.5 to 50 million). The
              reason was a restricted migration policy in major receiving
              countries. Few countries welcomed migrants from former Soviet
              states, primarily on ethnical basis, namely Germany, Israel, and
              the USA.

              The Soviet migration to these countries had varied levels of
              impact. All three countries welcomed the highly skilled labor that
              the immigrants had to offer. Most Russian Americans and Russian
              Germans have assimilated and integrated well into society, though
              many still consider themselves Russian. In Israel, it is hard to
              understate the impact of the Soviet Jewish migration, where it
              reshaped the countries demographics and politics.
