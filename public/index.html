            At the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, there were 53 ethnic
            homelands, 15 of which became successor states to the Soviet Union.
            In the <span class="emph">14 newly created sovereign states</span>,
            Members of the Russian diaspora had lost their status as a

              At the same time, the gates to emigration were finally opened. The

                Previous to the collapse, getting explicit permission from the
                government to travel abroad was highly unlikely. Traveling

              When looking at net immigration, it's clear that Ukraine
              contributed the vast majority of Russian immigrants deciding to

              What’s interesting is that in spite of continued movement into the
              country, Russias population has been declining by 0.5% annually
              after peaking at 148.7 million in 1992.

                Two factors contributed most to this. First, Russias birth rates plummeted 
                just as its mortality rates spiked. This was a nation navigating the complete
                collapse of an ideology.

              Meanwhile, Israel was welcoming soviet jewish migrants with open
              arms. Jews were persecuted and oppressed as a matter of policy by
              the soviet regime. As soon as the Iron Curtain came down, The
              1990s Post-Soviet aliyah began en mass. Between 1989 and 2006,
              over 1.6 million soviet jews and their non-jewish relatives and
              spouses moved to Israel, protected under the “Law of Return” which

              The United States was an important benefactor of all soviet
              immigrants. Between 1974 and 1990 the majority of Soviet Jews
              chose to travel to the United States over Israel. The United

              In summary, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russias population
              stayed surprisingly steady. Today, large Soviet communities thrive in Israel, 
              the United States, and Germany. This concludes our look at major migration patterns
              after the fall of the USSR.
