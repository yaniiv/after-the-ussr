              On Christams Day of 1991, at 7:32pm, the Soviet flag was lowered
              for the last time. Without moving an inch, 25.3 million Russians
              became part of a large diaspora. Where did they go?

            At the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, there were 53 ethnic
            homelands, 15 of which became successor states to the Soviet Union.
            In the 14 newly independent nation states, an average of 18.2% of
            the population consisted of Russians. Members of this Russian
            diaspora had

              At the same time, international emigration for the entire Soviet
              population became an option for the first time since 1922.
              Previous to the collapse, getting explicit permission from the
              government to travel abroad was highly unlikely. Traveling without
              it was punishable by prison time and in some cases death.

              To get a snapshot of Post-Soviet migration patterns, we’ll look at
              the reconcentration of Russians around their homeland, and take a
              glimpse at some of the primary streams of migration to countries
              outside the former USSR between 1989 and 2007.

              In 1989, Russia had a total population of XXX. Of the 14 newly
              created nations,
              <span class="emph">Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Kazakstan</span>
              contained the majority of all people in the Former Soviet Union
              States.

              The same 3 countries had the largest number of diaspora members.
              Russians in Ukraine represented 45% of the entire diaspora.

              When looking at net immigration, we see that also Ukraine
              contributed the most to Russias net population increase due to
              diaspora migration.

              What’s interesting is that in spite of continued movement into the
              country, Russias population has been declining by 0.5% annually
              after peaking at 148.7 million in 1992. Some of the decline is due
              to the steep increase in mortality rate and decrease in birth rate
              in Russia. The other part is due to internattion emigration

              Migration to the far abroad consisted of 3 groups: Germans,

              Three non FSU countries received the bulk of persons leaving

              In Germany, net migration consisted of soviet germans attracted by
              the generous resettlement package for the aussiedler (cultural
              germans) and strong german economy. The aussiedler were welcomed
              enthusiastically as fellow German compatriots who would be a
              benefit to the economy

              Meanwhile, Israel was welcoming soviet jewish migrants with open
              arms. Jews were persecuted and oppressed as a matter of policy by
              the soviet regime. As soon as the Iron Curtain came down, The
              1990s Post-Soviet aliyah began en mass. Between 1989 and 2006,
              over 1.6 million soviet jews and their non-jewish relatives and
              spouses moved to Israel, protected under the “Law of Return” which
              stated that  "every Jew has the right to come to this country as
              an oleh [immigrant]."

              Overall, About 61%, of Soviet Jews migrated to Israel. Another
              325,000 migrated to the United States, and 219,000 migrated
              to Germany.[2][3]

              The United States was an important benefactor of all soviet
              immigrants. Between 1974 and 1990 the majority of Soviet Jews
              chose to travel to the United States over Israel. The United
              States had a policy of treating Soviet Jews as refugees under the
              Jackson-Vanik amendment
