          At the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, there were 53 ethnic
          homelands, 15 of which became the successor states to the Soviet
          Union. In the 14 newly independent nation states, about 30% of the
          population consisted of Russians. Members of the diaspora had lost
          their status as a privileged majority and had to decide wether to
          leave or assimilate.

            To get a picture of Post-Soviet migration patterns, we’ll look at
            the reconcentration of soviet ethnic groups around their homeland,
            and some of the primary streams of migration to countries outside
            the FSU between 1989 and 2002.

            When looking at the percentage of Russians that left against the

            This may be in part due to weak and struggling infrastructure in

            Some of this is due to the steep drop in birthrate and steep
            increase in mortality rate in Russia that happened over the same
            timeframe. These were of the effects on a nation navigating the
            collapse of an ideology and with it political infrastructure. (Birth

            But a significant part of this was also due to large waves of

            Meanwhile, Israel was welcoming soviet jewish migrants with open
            arms. Life for jews in the Soviet Union was already difficult. Jews
            were persecuted and oppressed as a matter of policy by the soviet
            regime. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, things got even worse.
            Israel was fulfilling its founding purpose as a safe haven for Jews
            all around the world.

            The United States was an important benefactor of soviet immigrants.
            When the iron curtain initially fell, there was a period of time
            between 1993 to 19xx when jewish immigrants from Russia weren’t
            accepted any longer under law (XXX) because they had technically
            lost their “Refugee status”. Many immigrants went around that by
            first traveling to israel,a dn the moving over.

            What’s interesting is that all the countries benefited by what is
            referred to as the “Russian brain drain”. Highly skilled engineers
            trained in the Soviet Union left their countries and contribute
            their skills in Israel, Germany, and the USA. IT is estimated that
            between the years of 1990 and 20XX, 30% of all Microsoft products
            were built by Russian empkoyees. In Israel, soviet citizens
            dominated the tech force, and companies like XXX XXX XXX were all
            founded by soviet refugees.
