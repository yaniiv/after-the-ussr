              not actually as large as many experts had feared (up to 50

              from former Soviet states. The ones that did, Germany, Israel, and
              the USA, did so primarily on ethnic basis.

              Germans have assimilated and integrated well into society, though
              many still consider themselves Russian. In Israel, it is hard to
              understate the impact of the Soviet Jewish migration, where it
